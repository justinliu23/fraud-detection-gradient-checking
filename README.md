## Prerequisites

1. **Python Version**: Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your machine.
2. **Package Manager**: Install `pip`, the Python package installer.

## Running the Project

This project is designed to be run within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The following steps will guide you through running the project:

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook**: Open the terminal, navigate to the project directory, and start the Jupyter Notebook server:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open the Notebook**: In the Jupyter Notebook interface, open `Gradient_Checking.ipynb`

3. **Run the Cells**: Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially by selecting a cell and pressing `Shift + Enter`. This will run the code blocks and display the output inline.

### Example Usage

After setting up the environment and running the notebook, you can perform the following:

- **Problem Statement**: The project demonstrates building a deep learning model to detect fraudulent payments by using gradient checking to verify the correctness of backpropagation.

- **1-Dimensional Gradient Checking**: Implement and verify gradient checking on a simple 1D linear function to ensure that the derivative computation is accurate.

- **N-Dimensional Gradient Checking**: Extend the gradient checking technique to N-dimensional scenarios and apply it to more complex models.
